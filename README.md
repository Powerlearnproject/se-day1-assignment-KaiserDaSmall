Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is process of creating software applications. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it is the process developers use to create everything that makes a computer function.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The beginning of software engineering:
In 1968 the term "software engineering" was coined. At this time computer programming was recognised as a seperate discipline necessary for the development for complex software system.
The creation/rise of programming languages:
Frotan, while not the first programming language, revolutionized scientific computing . It was the first widely used programming lanuage, demonstrated the and introduced concepts like loops, conditional statements, and subroutines.
The rise of object-oriented programming:
Object orientated programming allowed coding to be more modular, flexible, reusable and scalable.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenence

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall method is split into distinct rigid linear phases.Meaning each phase of the project is doen one after the other. An example of this is creating a basic web application.
In contrast to the rigid linear nature of the waterfall method, the agile method is more iterative with new itterations of software being delivered every two to four weeks in sprints. Each sprint can be considered a finished product. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer are responsible for the programming, creation and maintenece of software.
Quality Assurence Engineers tests the software to make sure that it's reliable, functional and meets quality standards.
Project Managers oversee the project, ensure it is delivered on time, on budget and meets buisness goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance productivity, improve code quality, streamlines collaboration, simplifies setup/configuration, it's begginer friendly and optimizes peformance.
VCS manage source code allowing teams to work together more effectively, maintain code quality and ensure project stability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A very common challenge faced by software engineers is changing requirements. This often occurs due to changing needs of the project. The agile method is the best way to solve this issue because it allows you to make changes very quickly.
Debugging/Troubleshooting often delays projects and shifts project timelines. The way to solve this issue is making use of debugging tools, write unit tests and adopt systematic approaches to troubleshooting.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: a method used to test how functional a unit of code is. It's importance lies in the fact it hleps improve software design by exposing problems ,encouraging the use of best practices, documents how a piece of code is supposed to function and it helps developers how code is meant to work.
Integration testing: it verifies that the diffent poarts of the software work together as intended. It's importance lies in how it detects defects in the interface, makes sure data flows accurately and improves system reliability.
System testing: the testing of complete and integrated software to ensure it meets specific requirements. It's importance lies in the fact that it verifies system complice with industry standards/regulations, ensures system is ready to be used by limiting any post release issues and promotes confidence of the clients.
Acceptance testing: it is when the end user evaluates the software to ensure it meets the requirements and is ready for deployment. It's importance lies in how it ensures all end user requirements are met, promotes end user engagement and improves quality/reliablity.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering the process of writing instructions to get the best results from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Write me a poem about flowers
Improved prompt: Improved prompt: Write me a sonnet about flowers in iambic pentameter ,be sure to include no similes and make it about love

The imporved more concise prompt allows the AI to meet my desired result by modifying it to my specifications whilst the vauge prompt is more likely to provide a randomised result.
